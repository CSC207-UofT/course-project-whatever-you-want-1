This application is an online community where like minded people can share study notes or resources.


Intro

There are generally a series of steps to learning anything. For example, student A who wants to learn to build an android app would first need to learn java, design concepts, version control, etc. This app represents these steps using a technical tree, where each node represents a step and each directed edge represents the order in which users are suggested to complete the steps. A technical tree for student A may look like something similar to below:

Java Basics → Design Concepts ↘ 

                            app development
      Version Control ↗

There may also be other technical trees, such as a Math technical tree, for learning various concepts in different areas.


Community & Posts

Each node has an associated community, where users can post study notes, guides, codes and resources. Users can also like or comment on others' posts, or subscribe to other users to get notification of their future posts. In addition, users can download the resources uploaded by other users to use as learning material.

Unlocking New Nodes

New users only have access to low level nodes, such as Java Basics, or Python Basics. To unlock higher level nodes, users must complete the tasks within previous nodes. For example, in order to advance to the “Design Concepts” node, users must create a post and review three posts created by other users in the community of “Java Basics” node.

New Technical Trees

Users are free to create their own technical trees for any subjects, and these can be made public for others to unlock with reward points (which will be explained later) and participate in its communities. Users can also rate others’ technical trees.

Reward System

Users can gain reward points from the number of likes their posts received, the ratings of their technical trees, daily signups, or completing achievements. Users can use reward points to unlock new trees. Other digital contents that users can unlock may include new skins for their technical trees and UI.


Achievement System

There is a list of achievements for users to complete. New users will have none of the achievements completed and they can complete them by engaging in various actions. For example, the user may complete an achievement called “Make the First Post!” by making their first post in a community. New achievements may also be added by us in the future to encourage user engagement.
